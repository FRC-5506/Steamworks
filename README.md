# Jeffrey `v2.0`
This is the code that FRC 5506 used for the **second** competition for FRC 2017. 
> This is for the second comp (Pine Tree Event, `2017melew`).
> Significant changes were made between first and second comp (to both the robot and the code) so refer to the `old-code` branch for older code.

# Controls
Controls subject to change based on driver preference.

### Sticks
Drive robot (tank drive)
### Left Bumper
Toggle speed (between 100% (default) and 50%, reflected by green "Power" indicator on SmartDashboard)

---
### Right Bumper
Climb (100% power)
### `B`
Climb (50% power)
> Use to hold position at top of touch pad

---
*The following controls will always be mapped to the controller, but aren't likely to be used at competition:*
### `A`
Kill auto code and routines (such as automatic gear loading)
### `Y`
Load gear (runs `Gear` auto routine, even in teleop, requires both "Pi" and "Power" indicators to be green on SmartDashboard)
### `X`
Rewind climber (50% power, use during demonstrations to lower robot)
